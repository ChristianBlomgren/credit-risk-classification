## Overview of the Analysis

The purpose of this analysis is to test a machine learning model's ability to accurately predict and classify credit risk labels.

## Summarization of Machine Learning Model Scores Obtained

* Precision: This score shows the ratio of correctly predicted positive observations (True Positives) to the total predicted positive observations (True Positives and False Positives). 
This model scored a 100% on the predicted healthy loans and an 86% on the predicted high-risk loans.

* Recall: This score shows the ratio of correctly predicted positives to all actual positives. 
This model scored a 99% on correctly identifying actual healthy loans while also scoring a 91% on correctly identifying actual high-risk laons.

* F1-Score: This score is the harmonic mean of both the precision and recall scores. It provides a balanced look at the two.
The overall score for predicting healthy loans is 100% and the overall score for predicting high-risk loans is 88%.

## End Summary/Recommendation

This machine learning model has proven to perform fairly well and has managed to produce scorings of at least 88% and higher. This type of model may not be ideal for predicting labels in - for example - medical data, but for loan predictions it should prove more than adequate.
